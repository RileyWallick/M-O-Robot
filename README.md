# **Wall-E M-O Robot**
### A learning and engineering project by Riley Wallick

This project is an attempt to make a movie accurate version of the M-O bot from the Wall-E movie. The robot is planned to be gyroscopically balanced on a single sphere that will be used for locomotion to match the movie as close as possible. This repository will include informal planning documentation and notes of what I am learning / planning as I advance through the project.
